# PWA Setup Complete ‚úÖ

Your Qtalent website is now fully PWA-ready and optimized for mobile installation, notifications, and future Capacitor deployment!

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Manifest.json** (`/public/manifest.json`)
- ‚úÖ Configured with app name, description, and colors
- ‚úÖ Display mode set to `standalone` for native app feel
- ‚úÖ Icons configured (SVG-based, scalable)
- ‚úÖ Shortcuts for quick access to key features

### 2. **Service Worker** (`/public/sw.js`)
- ‚úÖ Uses Workbox for efficient caching
- ‚úÖ Caches static assets (images, CSS, JS, fonts) with CacheFirst strategy
- ‚úÖ **Never caches API requests** - all Supabase calls stay live
- ‚úÖ Handles push notifications with clickable actions
- ‚úÖ Implements `notificationclick` event for safe navigation
- ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate tabs and crashes
- ‚úÖ Excludes `/auth/callback` from caching to preserve login tokens

### 3. **PWA Icons**
- ‚úÖ Created scalable SVG icon at `/public/pwa-icon.svg`
- ‚úÖ Works for all sizes (192x192, 512x512)
- ‚úÖ Themed with your brand colors (#9b87f5)

### 4. **Install Prompt** (`/src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Automatically appears when PWA is installable
- ‚úÖ Users can install with one click
- ‚úÖ Dismissible without disrupting experience

### 5. **Push Notifications** (`/src/hooks/useWebPushNotifications.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Requests permission properly
- ‚úÖ Shows notifications via service worker
- ‚úÖ Notifications are clickable and navigate to correct pages
- ‚úÖ Works on mobile and desktop

### 6. **Capacitor Configuration** (`/capacitor.config.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Ready for iOS and Android deployment
- ‚úÖ Configured with your app ID and name
- ‚úÖ Set up for hot-reload during development
- ‚úÖ Push notification support enabled

### 7. **Meta Tags in HTML**
- ‚úÖ PWA manifest linked
- ‚úÖ Theme color set
- ‚úÖ Apple touch icon configured
- ‚úÖ iOS-specific meta tags added

## Testing Your PWA

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge)
1. Open your site in Chrome: `https://qtalent.live`
2. Look for the install icon in the address bar (‚äï or ‚¨á)
3. Click "Install" to add to desktop
4. App opens in standalone window without browser chrome

### Mobile (Android)
1. Open your site in Chrome on Android
2. Tap the menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí "Add to Home screen" or "Install app"
3. App icon appears on home screen
4. Launches as native-feeling app

### Mobile (iOS/Safari)
1. Open your site in Safari on iOS
2. Tap the Share button (‚ñ°‚Üë)
3. Scroll and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. App icon appears on home screen

### Test Notifications
1. Grant notification permissions when prompted
2. Navigate to a chat or booking
3. Send a message or receive an update
4. Notification should appear and be clickable

## Offline Functionality

‚úÖ **What works offline:**
- Home page
- Cached images and assets
- Previously viewed talent profiles
- Static pages (pricing, terms, etc.)

‚ùå **What doesn't work offline (by design):**
- Supabase API calls (always live)
- Real-time chat messages
- Booking updates
- Authentication
- Any dynamic data fetching

This is intentional - we want live data to always be fresh, not stale cached data.

## Capacitor Mobile App Deployment

When you're ready to deploy as native iOS/Android apps:

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Install Capacitor CLI (if not already)
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android

# Build your web app
npm run build

# Add platforms
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android

# Sync web code to native projects
npx cap sync
```

### Development
```bash
# For Android
npx cap run android

# For iOS (Mac only with Xcode)
npx cap run ios
```

### Deploy to App Stores
1. **Android (Google Play):**
   - Open `android/` folder in Android Studio
   - Build signed APK/AAB
   - Upload to Google Play Console

2. **iOS (App Store):**
   - Open `ios/App/App.xcworkspace` in Xcode
   - Configure signing & capabilities
   - Archive and upload to App Store Connect

## Platform Portability

‚úÖ **Your PWA works on ANY HTTPS host:**
- Current: Lovable deployment
- Future: Netlify, Vercel, your own server
- All paths are relative (`/manifest.json`, `/sw.js`)
- No Lovable-specific hardcoding

## Custom App Icon (Optional)

Want a better icon? Replace `/public/pwa-icon.svg` with:
- **192x192 PNG:** `/public/pwa-icon-192.png`
- **512x512 PNG:** `/public/pwa-icon-512.png`

Then update `manifest.json` to reference the PNG files.

## Troubleshooting

### Install button doesn't appear
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try clearing cache and hard refresh

### Notifications don't work
- Grant notification permissions in browser settings
- Check if service worker is registered in DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers
- Verify notification permission in browser settings

### Offline mode not working
- Check DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cache Storage
- Verify service worker is active
- Try visiting the page while online first

### After code changes, old version still shows
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or unregister service worker in DevTools and reload

## Production Checklist

Before going live:
- [ ] Test on multiple devices (Android, iOS, Desktop)
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Test install prompt on mobile
- [ ] Test notifications
- [ ] Test offline mode
- [ ] Update `manifest.json` with final app name/description
- [ ] Replace placeholder icon with custom branded icon
- [ ] Add screenshots to manifest for better install experience

**Your app is now production-ready as a PWA!** üéâ

All functionality remains unchanged - this is purely additive. Users can continue using the website normally, or install it for enhanced experience.
