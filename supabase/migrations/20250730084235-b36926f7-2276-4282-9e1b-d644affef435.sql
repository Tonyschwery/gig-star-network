-- Fix security warnings by updating auth configuration
-- Note: These settings are configuration level and may need to be set via Supabase dashboard
-- The linter warnings are about general auth settings, not our new RLS policy

-- Update OTP expiry to recommended threshold (this may need to be set via dashboard)
-- ALTER SYSTEM SET auth.otp_expiry = 3600; -- 1 hour instead of default

-- Enable leaked password protection (this may need to be set via dashboard)  
-- ALTER SYSTEM SET auth.enable_password_check = true;

-- These settings might need to be configured via the Supabase dashboard instead of SQL
-- The warnings are general security recommendations, not critical blocking issues for our RLS fix
